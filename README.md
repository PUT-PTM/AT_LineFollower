How to compile and run

Program was written with usage of MkClipse IDE, which is very nice tool for writing programs
designed for ATmega microcontrollers (it takes care of flashing program to controller too).
Although no specific IDE/compiler is required - just make sure that your choice have
libraries for Atmega88 included.

Future improvements

One of ideas for improvements would be adding some additonal sensors in front of robot to detect
obstacles (like small books especially placed on road) and implement method to avoid them.
Also, motors could be replaced with more powerful versions.

us pen for no reason stating that he would like to give us some kind of support :)
